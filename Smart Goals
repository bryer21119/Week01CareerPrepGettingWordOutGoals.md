RESUME IMPROVEMENTS

A few things I could do to improve my resume after viewing my classmates resumes are:
Add a skills section
Add a projects section
Add a section that describes the languages I have used and the programs I have created with them.

JOB POSTINGS AND EVALUATIONS

I have applied to these three jobs recently. Two being internships and one being a full-time job. They all seem to be something I could excel at and I have the knowledge to do great in them.

Parallels:

I am well versed in a lot of the programming languages needed for most of the jobs that I applied to.
I am interested in Full Stack Development.
A lot of these posting ask for someone that is familiar with full stack development and I have prior knowledge of it.
Most companies want you to be familiar with Github and I have some experience with that.

Improvements:

I could improve upon my programming skills and focus on one specific area of programming.
I could hone my skills as a full stack developer and create more programs on my own to practice these skills.

SMART GOALS

I was unable to get feedback from several classmates 

SMART goal 1: Add projects to my resume 
SMART goal 2: Learn more advanced programming practices by the end of the year.
